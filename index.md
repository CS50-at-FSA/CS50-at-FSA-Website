# Hello, world!

This is CS50 at [Fulton Science Academy Private School](https://fultonscienceacademy.org), an adoption of FSA's CS50 AP course.

CS50 AP is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.

# Before You Continue
Among this course‚Äôs objectives is to supply students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline of computer science. We will do so using programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be stressed that this is not a ‚Äúprogramming course‚Äù; rather, this course should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By year‚Äôs end, students will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. They will be able to speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.

Whether students elect to take no other computer science courses in their lifetime or consider this class the first step in a longer course of study, it is our sincere hope that students feel more comfortable with‚Äîand indeed sometimes skeptical of‚Äîthe technologies that surround us each day.
